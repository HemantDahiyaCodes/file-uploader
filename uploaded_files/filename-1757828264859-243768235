Hell yes, Hemant. Getting hands-on is the **only real way** to internalize Prisma. I’ll give you a **progressive ladder** of exercises — starting simple, then scaling up to real-world tasks. No bullshit.

## 🧱 Beginner – Warmup (Basics of Schema & CRUD)

**Goal:** Get comfy with models, relations, and Prisma Client.

### ✅ Exercise 1: Basic User model

1. Set up a new Prisma project with SQLite/Postgres
2. Create a `User` model:

   ```prisma
   model User {
     id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String
     email String @unique
   }
   ```
3. Generate the client
4. Create a script to:

   * Add a new user
   * Fetch all users
   * Find a user by email

---

### ✅ Exercise 2: Add a `Post` model with relation

1. Add:

   ```prisma
   model Post {
     id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
     title   String
     content String
     userId  Int
     user    User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
   }
   ```
2. Write scripts to:

   * Create a user with multiple posts
   * Fetch a user along with their posts
   * Update a post’s content

---

## 🧩 Intermediate – Relations & Filters

### ✅ Exercise 3: Filtering and ordering

* Get all posts of a user ordered by creation date
* Find users who have written **more than 2 posts**

Use `where`, `orderBy`, `include`, `select` options.

---

### ✅ Exercise 4: Pagination

* Implement pagination for posts (limit + offset)
* Bonus: Write a function that returns the **total post count** + **paginated results**

---

### ✅ Exercise 5: Many-to-many

Add a `Category` model and a many-to-many relation:

```prisma
model Post {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  title      String
  categories Category[] @relation("PostCategories")
}

model Category {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  posts Post[] @relation("PostCategories")
}
```

Create posts with multiple categories. Fetch posts by category.

---

## 🔥 Advanced – Real-World-Like Scenarios

### ✅ Exercise 6: Data migration script

* Add a `published` field to the `Post` model (default: false)
* Write a migration script to set all existing posts as `published = true`

---

### ✅ Exercise 7: Transactional logic

* Write a function to create a user and their initial post **in one transaction**
* Simulate failure to test rollback

```ts
await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.user.create(...),
  prisma.post.create(...)
])
```

---

### ✅ Exercise 8: Raw SQL

* Use `$queryRaw` to get post count by user
* Use `$executeRaw` to bulk update post titles (e.g., add “Draft:” prefix to unpublished posts)

---

## 🛠 Bonus (if you want to build confidence)

### ✅ Project Idea: Simple Blog API

* Users can register
* Users can write/edit/delete posts
* Each post can have tags (many-to-many)
* Auth isn’t necessary right now — focus on **CRUD and Prisma patterns**

---

If you want, I’ll also:

* Create a repo template for you
* Or generate code snippets for each one

Just say the word.

Want these in a Notion doc or markdown format too?
